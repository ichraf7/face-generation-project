# Face Generation

this project is part of deep learning nanodegree offred by udacity .

In this project, I defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. the goal was to
get a generator network to generate *new* images of faces that look as realistic as
possible!

The project is broken down into a series of tasks from **loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks**. At the end of the notebook, you'll be
able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs.
